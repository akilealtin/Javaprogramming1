4. Write a program that can find the frequency of the characters from a
string
 Ex:
str = "aabcccd";
output:
a2b1c3d1
Hint: if you find out how to find the frequency of one
character, then repeat it for all the remaining characters
5. Write a program that can find the unique characters from a string
without using index() and lastIndexOf() methods
Ex:
str = "aabccdeef";
output:
bdf
Hint: if you find out how to find the frequency of one
character, then you can repeat it for the remaining characters to find the
frequency.
if frequency of a character == 1  =========>
unique
